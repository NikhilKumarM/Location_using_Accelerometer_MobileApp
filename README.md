# Location_using_Accelerometer_MobileApp

This is the android mobile app that can be used to find the location using the acceleromter and gyroscope sensor values. When the app starts, the initial
location is determined by using either GPS or Network. Then, by taking that initial location as reference, now as the user moves with his mobile in his hand, the
new location's latitude and longitude are determined by using the acceleromter and gyroscope values.The error is about less than 0.5 miles from the original 
location in distance.
